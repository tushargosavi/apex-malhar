/**
 * Keeps track of time buckets and triggers purging of obsolete time-buckets that moved out of boundary.<br/>
 *
 * The data of a bucket is further divided into time-buckets. This component controls the length of time buckets,
 * which time-bucket an event falls into and sliding the time boundaries.
 * <p/>
 *
 * The configuration {@link #expireBefore}, {@link #bucketSpan} and {@link #referenceInstant} (default time: system
 * time during initialization of TimeBucketAssigner) are used to calculate number of time-buckets.<br/>
 * For eg. if <code>expireBefore = 1 hour</code>, <code>bucketSpan = 30 minutes</code> and
 * <code>rererenceInstant = currentTime</code>, then <code>
 *   numBuckets = 60 minutes/ 30 minutes = 2 </code>.<br/>
 *
 * These properties once configured shouldn't be changed because that will result in different time-buckets
 * for the same (key,time) pair after a failure.
 * <p/>
 *
 * The time boundaries- start and end, move by multiples of time-bucket span. Any event with time < start
 * is considered expired. The boundaries slide by {@link #getTimeBucket(long)}. The time which is passed as an
 * argument to this method can be ahead of <code>end</code>. This means that the corresponding event is a future event
 * (wrt TimeBucketAssigner) and cannot be ignored. Therefore it is accounted by sliding boundaries further.
